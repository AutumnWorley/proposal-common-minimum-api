# Minimum Common API

The idea behind the Minimum Common API is to document the minimal collection of Web Platform APIs that ought to be implemented by Web-interoperable runtimes.

## How are the APIs selected

By looking at the APIs that are already implemented and supported in common across Node.js, Deno, and Cloudflare Workers. If there were at least two implementations among those -- either already supported or in progress -- then it was added to the list.

## Is the list finalized?

Oh heavens no. The initial draft is just an initial draft. A first stab at a collection we need to work through and finalize.

## How do we decide what makes the final list?

I don't know yet. That's something we still need to work through.
